# LiteBridge – Clean & Focused Web Browsing

**LiteBridge** is a minimal and privacy-conscious browser extension that helps you bridge the gap between you and the actual content. It removes cluttered, irrelevant webpage elements—ads, pop-ups, tracking scripts, sidebars, and more—so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## What's in Progress?

While the extension's core functionality is fully built and operational, we are currently training a machine learning model to enhance LiteBridge’s intelligence. The goal is to make content filtering smarter and more context-aware, adapting dynamically to different types of web pages.

The current version uses rule-based logic, with ML-powered filtering to be integrated in a future release.
